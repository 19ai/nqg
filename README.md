# Neural Question Generation 

## Overview

Implementation of neural question generation system for reading comprehension tasks. Sentence-level model and paragraph-level model will be made available soon.

<!--## Getting Started

Assuming you have g++ and the code here, running the bash script as

	bash run.sh

should

1. download small word embeddings (25 dimensional CW)
2. download the preprocessed MPQA dataset
3. download the Eigen library
4. compile and run to train a small model on the ESE task to be saved to disk.

That's it! Once you have a working setup, you can play with the hyperparameters or pick different word embeddings (300d word2vec is used in the experiments in the paper).
